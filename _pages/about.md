After so many years of pushing this task down the road, I am finally
building this personal space in the web-o-sphere. I have been writing
down ideas for years...

The first gig  will be "The Big Bouncy Mattress" which gets it's name
from a radio show on WBCN Boston in the 70's. Sidebar being that I date
myself as another 'Hippie Dippy Web Hacker' but such is life.  Labels,
Labels, Labels everywhere and hardly ever catch an essence. So, off we
go !!! look for references to Charles L and Mattress Michigas as the BBM
unfolds and a universe of unassociated subjects are tied together by
gravity sometimes and sometimes not.

The Blog will be the starting point but branches will emerge and I'll
point out the trail heads here for those who enjoy exploring with me.
