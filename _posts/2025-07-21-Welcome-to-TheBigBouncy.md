I can see clearly now, the rain is gone<br />
I can see all obstacles in my way<br />
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind<br />
<br />
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)<br />
Sun-shiny day<br />
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)<br />
Sun-shiny day<br />

                           - Song By Johnny Nash - 1972
